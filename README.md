# Emography - Graphical Password Authentication
## Introduction
### Emography is a unique and secure user authentication method that allows users to safeguard their files using emojified passwords.
### Traditional text-based passwords are often susceptible to brute-force attacks and can be challenging to remember. 
### Emography offers a visually appealing and highly secure alternative by enabling users to create passwords using a combination of emojis.



## Features
### Emojified Passwords: Users can create passwords using a sequence of emojis, making them visually memorable and challenging to crack.
### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Emography supports two-factor authentication for an additional layer of security, combining emojis and a 
### one-time code sent to the user's registered device.
### File Safeguarding: Users can protect their sensitive files using Emography's secure authentication, ensuring only authorized individuals can 
### access the protected files.
### User-Friendly Interface: The Emography interface is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through the process of setting up their emojified 
### passwords and managing their files.
### Cross-Platform Compatibility: Emography can be used on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

## How it Works
### Account Registration: Users need to create an Emography account by providing their email and setting up a master password.
### Emojified Password Creation: Once registered, users can create their emojified passwords by selecting a sequence of emojis from a predefined set or 
### customizing their sequence.
### Two-Factor Authentication Setup: For added security, users have the option to enable two-factor authentication. This involves linking their mobile device 
### to receive one-time codes during login.
### File Safeguarding: After setting up their account and emojified password, users can upload and safeguard their files on the Emography platform. 
### These files will only be accessible when the correct emojified password and 2FA code (if enabled) are provided.
### Authentication Process: During login, users are presented with a grid of emojis from which they need to recreate their emojified password. If 2FA is enabled, t
### they will also need to enter the one-time code sent to their registered device.
### File Access: Upon successful authentication, users can access and manage their protected files.

## Security
### Emography takes security very seriously and employs several measures to ensure the safety of user data:
### Encryption: All user data, including passwords and files, are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.
### Salted Hashing: User passwords are salted and hashed before storage, protecting them even in the event of a data breach.
### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Users have the option to enable 2FA for an extra layer of protection.
### Regular Security Audits: The Emography team conducts regular security audits and updates the system to address any potential vulnerabilities.
### Privacy: Emography follows a strict privacy policy to ensure that user data is not shared with third parties without explicit consent.
